# Graph-Theory
Implementing the Graph Data Structure and a number of different methods on it.
The implementation includes directed, undirected, and weighted graphs and different methods such as:
- BFS, DFS
- cyclicity
- topological sorting, (strongly) connected components
- DAG of strongly connected components
- Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Bellman-Ford algorithm
- Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
- Johnson's Algorithm



...To run, type `make` followed by `./graph`.
