# Graph-Theory
Implementing the Graph Data Structure and a number of different methods on it.
The implementation includes directed, undirected, and weighted graphs and different methods such as:
⋅⋅*BFS, DFS
⋅⋅*cyclicity
⋅⋅*topological sorting, (strongly) connected components
⋅⋅*DAG of strongly connected components
⋅⋅*Dijkstra's Algorithm
⋅⋅*Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
⋅⋅*Floyd-Warshall Algorithm
⋅⋅*Bellman-Ford algorithm


⋅⋅⋅To run, type `make` followed by `./graph`.
